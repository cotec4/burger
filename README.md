# Description:
In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
        
# Installation:
You have to have Node.js, MySQL, Express and Handlebars installed to run this project.
        
# Usage:
This can be used by anyone who is looking to track burgers they want to try and burgers they have eaten.
        
# Licensing:
None
        
# Contributing:
I got help on this from TAs, my tutor and classmates
        
# Tests:
Simply run node index.js and test it
